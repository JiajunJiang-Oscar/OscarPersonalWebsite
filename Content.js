    autobiographyParagraphs: [
        "My name is Jiang Jiajun. You can call me Oscar. I am a student studying cybersecurity at James Cook " +
        "University. The reason I created this website is to showcase myself in front of everyone and share my story as " +
        "well as my portfolio during my school years. Hope you will like my work!",

        "I was born in Tianjin—a northern city that doesn’t chase attention, yet moves with confidence, quietly " +
        "modern, quietly alive. It’s where I grew up, and where I learned what it means to be ordinary.",

        "In school, I was never the top student.",
        "Not even close.",

        "My grades were often disappointing, my performance forgettable, and for years I believed that effort didn’t " +
        "necessarily lead to change. The future felt like something already written for other people, not for me.",

        "When university applications came, I didn’t get into the major I truly wanted. It wasn’t dramatic—it was a " +
        "dull, heavy kind of resignation. The kind that makes you think maybe this is it, maybe your life is just " +
        "going to follow a path you never chose.",

        "Until I was given a second chance.",

        "My parents decided to send me to Singapore for college, and suddenly, for the first time, I was allowed to choose for " +
        "myself. That moment cracked something open in me-the realization that a life can be rewritten.",

        "So I chose cybersecurity. Not because it was easy, or popular, but because it was the first decision that " +
        "genuinely felt like mine.",

        "The early days were anything but easy. A new language. A new system. A new rhythm I couldn’t follow. Lectures " +
        "blurred together, assignments stacked faster than I could clear them, and the pressure sat heavy on my " +
        "chest—quiet, persistent, suffocating.",

        "But back then, I told myself:",
        "If this was the path I chose, then I would walk it. Even if it scraped me raw, even if I had to crawl through it.",

        "So I kept going—teeth clenched, sleeves rolled. From barely understanding, to slowly keeping pace; from " +
        "surviving on willpower, to finally thinking in the language I learned.",

        "My skills built themselves quietly, layer by layer. My thoughts sharpened. My understanding took shape. It " +
        "wasn’t a dramatic transformation—just steady growth, like something unfolding underground.",

        "And one day when I looked back, I realized. From the moment I arrived in Singapore, my timeline had split. " +
        "That was the beginning of my second life the first chapter I ever wrote myself."
