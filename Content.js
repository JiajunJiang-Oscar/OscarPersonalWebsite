  aboutParagraphs: [
    "Hi, I’m Oscar. I study cybersecurity and software engineering in Singapore, and I like understanding how systems work – both the technical side and the human side.",
    "In my coursework and labs, I’ve worked with Kali, Metasploitable2, and OPNsense to explore network defence, basic exploitation, and traffic analysis. I enjoy turning these experiments into clear notes and visuals.",
    "Outside of pure security, I also build small apps and tools in Swift, Kotlin, Python, and Django. For me, building software and studying security are two sides of the same thing: learning how to make technology more reliable and safer for people."
